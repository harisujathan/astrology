8th lord in 10th extreme debilitated(my case) : you are very poor in studies/work but you are *extremely happy* (verified in my work related antar dasas as well where I had to debug thousands of tables, yet was full time enjoyment)(8th debilitated is VRY sarala). 1981-1989 were happiest days in my life though I was *poor in studies* (10th includes 7th and 4th , and 4th house=studies). 
5th lord in 10th extreme debilitated(my case) : _Should have been worst_ , but 5th lord in 10th debilitated antar dasa was full fun time for me(jumping company for better pay?). Increase in earnings even though didn't work much. (Did it give effect of 9th and 3rd house is confusion?)

Satya yuga begins when sun+moon+jupiter together enter pushya simultaneously. What combination started kali yuga?
I have strange sun+moon+jupiter combination where sun+jupiter in moon's nakshatra and moon in jupiter nakshatra. Is it dangerous?

Queen Victoria's jupiter was just fine as 8th lord debilitated in 9th= poor in religion though in leo navamsa=strong religion. More importantly exalted  5th lord mercury joining vargottama ketu in navamsa saved the situation.

Currently smoking aces(a self setup?). 
Ketu as 8th lord in 8th, many have you in hitlist. Moon in 8th: you have many in hitlist. First option is always better.
